# Project-1---API-Call
For project 1, I will use the weather API from [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to create an interactive site for users to check the current weather!

This API is very powerful because it contains up-to-date information on weather around the world from temperature to wind speed. I plan on using the various pieces of data to create a dynamic result depending on if it is rainy, sunny, or cloudy. My site will also incorperate suggestions for clothing or accessories. For example, if it is raining, the text at the bottom will suggest the user to bring an umbrella. I will create a Trello board to set and reach daily goals and continue innovating the design and functionality of my site. 

Here is a general layout of what my site will look like, although this is only my first draft.

##MVP 
By the End of today (2/3)
- [ ] Create a Trello board planning out the rest of project week so that by the end of my work I will have 20 meaningful git commits
- [ ] fully explore the [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com) more in depth to get a better sense of all of the data I have to work with. For example, I want to find all the possible conditions of weather (clear, cloudy, partially cloudy, etc.) so that I can create a polymorphous design. 
- [ ] Dedicate time to psuedocode for my HTML, CSS, and Javascript
    - Figure out what global variables I need
    - Plan out what functions I need 
    - Push myself with CSS and plan out an elegant design


##Stretch Goals
- [ ] A weather API call is probably one of the most common projects of all beginner coders. Think about what I can do to make mine stand out!
- [ ] Add an inspirational quote of the day at the bottom of my weather API
