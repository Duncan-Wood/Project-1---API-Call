# Project-1---API-Call
For project 1, I will use the weather API from [weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to create an interactive site for users to check the current weather!

This API is very powerful because it contains up-to-date information on weather around the world from temperature to wind speed. I plan on using the various pieces of data to create a dynamic result depending on if it is rainy, sunny, or cloudy. My site will also incorperate suggestions for clothing or accessories. For example, if it is raining, the text at the bottom will suggest the user to bring an umbrella. I will create a Trello board to set and reach daily goals and continue innovating the design and functionality of my site. 

Here is a general layout of what my site will look like, although this is only my first draft.
